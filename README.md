# GoogleSearchingToTxts

This project, when running by CLI, will prompt user for a keyword, and search the result with the help from google map api. After that, all results are placed in a txt file.

This project originates from my bro majoring in Bussiness who would like a convinient way to gather potential customer infomation. This is just a small tool for now that is probably useful in the future. 

This project plays around the functionality brought by google place api(new)
For new/come-back user, create or find ur own api key and place it in config.py
Then, run main.py from CLI, follow the instructions. Personally recommand the enhanced search.

# How to create my own api key?
Portal to Google cloud console: https://console.cloud.google.com/ (Yes u have to logged in with ur own account)
User will have to create his/her own Google cloud project at first for now.


# Notice: API limit
